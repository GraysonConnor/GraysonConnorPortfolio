Hi, I'm Grayson Connor, a frontend web developer based out of Austin, TX. I started coding about a year ago and fell in love with it instantly. I believe writing simple and reusable code and having the ability to effectively solve problems are the most important skills a developer can have. Refining these skills has become my focus and my abilities are growing each day.
