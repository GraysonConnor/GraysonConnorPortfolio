## Summary

The frontend portion of Bloc teaches the fundamentals of web development by having students create a simple and intuitive music player called Bloc Jams. Throughout the creation of Bloc Jams, Bloc guides students as they develop certain portions of the application but then allows students to create key components of the app on their own based on the knowledge they’ve gained. Bloc Jams was my first deep dive into coding and it proved to be challenging while at the same time being deeply satisfying.




## Explanation

The first iteration of Bloc Jams was created with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. After creating the first version of Bloc Jams, I was then tasked with refactoring Bloc Jams using React. Both versions of this project challenged me, but also gave me great opportunities for growth as a web developer.




## Problem

Since Bloc Jams was my first real-world development project, I found that most of the problems I encountered were what you’d call “rookie mistakes”. I quickly learned the importance of things like simple and concise naming conventions, proper indentation as to not get lost in the syntax, and that you can never over-use a browsers “inspect” function when trying to debug errors. There were many times during this project that I thought my application was breaking for some mysterious, hyper-complicated reason and I’d spend all of this time sifting through lines of code, when in reality I simply had an out of place semicolon or parentheses.

## Solution

With the help of my mentor I was refine my ability to write syntax efficiently and precisely. During the course of this project I developed an eye for looking at code and being able to see when something is wrong. For the more complex and programmatic challenges that Bloc Jams included, I was able to practice my skills in researching what other developers do to solve similar problems as the ones I face.



## Conclusion

While making this application, it became clear to me that there is a huge difference between web development in a tutorial environment and actually implementing it in real-world applications. Tutorials lay an excellent foundation of learning syntax and best practices, but coding a real application requires much more logic, creativity, and organization. I think making Bloc Jams has made me a better developer overall. Now I look forward to taking what I’ve learned from Bloc Jams and using it in my future projects.
