My wife, Bibi, needed a website to showcase the projects she has worked on as a web designer. So I made her one! This was my first development project outside of a tutorial environment, and let me tell you... it was a hoot. Since it was my first real-world project I'll be the first to admit that it doesn't have the cleanest or most efficient code, but it gets the job done. Making this website was a huge learning experience for me and I will definitely be taking the lessons I learned into future projects. The biggest challenge for me was making the site responsive and making it render properly on all browsers. I would say the responsiveness and cross browser compatibility is currently passable, but I would like to revisit this project in the future to turn this B into an A+. You can view the live site at bibiconnor.com.
